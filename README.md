#### Power System Simulation Platform
A real-time FPGA-based power system simulation platform developed as part of a diploma thesis. The platform integrates automation techniques and adaptive architecture selection, following a multi-stage workflow. It builds upon an existing framework for power system design and network analysis, leveraging integer fixed-point representation and using two distinct fraction lengths to achieve both high precision and resource efficiency. The platform categorizes the system in one of three input-based archtectures, depending on the type of sources (current, voltage, or both), and in one of three sized-based architectures, depending on its size (number of nodes).

#### Minimum Requirements
1. MATLAB R2017a
2. Vitis HLS 2020.2
3. Vivado 2020.2
4. Vitis 2020.2

#### Note
Newer versions of the software may be compatible, but the platform has been tested and validated with the versions listed above.

#### Instructions - Target `Zynq UltraScale+ ZCU104 Evaluation Board`
